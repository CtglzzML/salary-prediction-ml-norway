# Salary Prediction in Norway 🇳🇴

This project explores whether developer salaries in Norway can be predicted from data.

## 🔍 Overview
An end-to-end workflow:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data preprocessing (encoding, scaling)
- Model training and evaluation
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Results discussion and reflection

## ⚙️ Models Used
- Linear Regression
- Random Forest Regressor
- Support Vector Regressor (SVR)

## 📈 Results
- Random Forest (tuned) performed best with R² ≈ 0.52  
- Salaries are partly predictable, but personal factors still play a big role.
